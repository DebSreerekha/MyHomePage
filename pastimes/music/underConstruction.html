Ever since my childhood days I have been                  drawn to melodies and could hardly resist them ! I use to try to sing some of the melodies                  from movies to a decent closeness with the original and most of all I had this great urge                  to sing and hum to myself all the time . It was not until I realised that there is a way to                  understand the nuances of music ,from a technical point of view that I was struggling with my                  own ways of mimicing the melodies not knowing for sure if they were perfect !                  I was trained in Karnatic Music and slowly I could see the change in my approach to singing .                  Rather than a lay man's approach it was very technical and less prone to error !It did polish                  my crude ways and gave me a more disciplined approach to the subject !</font>                  </p>                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>                  <div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">                    <i><font color="#666666" size="2">Copyright &#169; 2009 <a href="">Sreerekha</a> | All Rights Reserved</font></i>                  </div>                </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </td>        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table></body></html>
