As a child I did not play much of it ! But in my twenties it had been the most engaging sport that I indulged in whenever and whereever time permitted !                    Even at work during breaks , with my team mates or any chess enthusiast for that matter .. If not playing , being an attentive spectator was also something I could not bring myself to refrain from !                    It was like a mad addiction in my twenties ! I happened to win against one of the online chess programs just once in March 2005 and that was my most priced moment , which I shared with my chess enthusiastic buddy circle                    .. I even saved that ending picture for quite sometime now ..I can say with sufficient confidence that I have just reached the intermediate level from the beginner level now !There is still a long long interesting                    journey ahead !					<br>                    Hope to use this space to capture some interesting games in the future !</font>                  </p>                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>                  <div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">                    <i><font color="#666666" size="2">Copyright &#169; 2009 <a href="../guestbook/index.html">Sreerekha</a> | All Rights Reserved</font></i>                  </div>                </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </td>        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table></body></html>
